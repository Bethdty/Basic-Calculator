# Basic-Calculator
A basic calculator to get used to more mathematical processes and logical thinking.

## First Commit
The initial planning behind this was just to get used to coding in a mathematical / analytical sense, and to further my logical thinking and how I would approach issues that came up.
I have a habit of over complicating things as I want them to be the best I can make them, therefore while this did initially start as a BASIC calculator, when I was coding it I was thinking up more and more ideas of how to further it and improve it. 
Once I completed this I realised I was not happy with the basic limitations, in that you can only input two numbers at a time. Due to this, I began rewriting it to include multiple inputs.
For this to work I had to begin slowly, building up from the two inputs to how I could manage more than this. 
This is where my logical thinking had to kick in; I started by drawing out diagrams to easily visualise the loops a scientific calculator memory would store in order to try and understand how it would process these inputs. Pulling from my algebraic knowledge helped with this, as when I began to see patterns I was able to translate this into my code.
