# Basic-Calculator
A basic calculator to get used to more mathematical processes and logical thinking.

## First Commit
The initial planning behind this was just to get used to coding in a mathematical / analytical sense, and to further my logical thinking and how I would approach issues that came up.

I have a habit of over complicating things as I want them to be the best I can make them, therefore while this did initially start as a BASIC calculator, when I was coding it I was thinking up more and more ideas of how to further it and improve it. 

Once I completed this I realised I was not happy with the basic limitations, in that you can only input two numbers at a time. Due to this, I began rewriting it to include multiple inputs.

For this to work I had to begin slowly, building up from the two inputs to how I could manage more than this. 
This is where my logical thinking had to kick in; I started by drawing out diagrams to easily visualise the loops a scientific calculator memory would store in order to try and understand how it would process these inputs. Pulling from my algebraic knowledge helped with this, as when I began to see patterns I was able to translate this into my code.


## Second Commit
This commit was much shorter than the initial entry. I wanted to add in more mathematical functions, and therefore decided that multiplication and division were the natural next step. 

Again, I was unhappy with the limitations of only two inputs, so once I figured out how to handle this basic process I again began to plan out the logic behind a calcultor handling the process. 

Through diagrams and the use of algebra I was able to visualise the loops that were required for this to work (and which sections were required to be held in memory). I then wrote out the loops, tested them, and uploaded once confident. 


## Third Commit
With this commit, I wanted to give the user more options when it came to percentages, as I feel limiting the process to just finding the percentage of a number doesn't provide as much choice as I would like to exhibit. As my whole focus for this project is to develop my skills with Python, I wanted to challenge myself to add this extra option under a predefined choice.

Again, I found it useful to call upon algebraic methods to clearly lay out how an individual would process such a question. I have found that using Mathematical functions has greatly helped me with this project in general, and I am excited to see where else I am able to apply this knowledge.
I found it quite difficult to word the inputs, and therefore added a brief template using the print() function in order to enable the user to read the process clearly, and understand how to input their request.
